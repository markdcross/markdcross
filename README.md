### Hi, folks! 👋

I'm Mark Cross and I'm enrolled in the University of Richmond Coding Bootcamp. Born and raised in Annapolis, MD, graduate of the University of Delaware (go Blue Hens 🐓), and now Richmond local. I've spent my career in sales and sales leadership, having recently served as the head of sales for Richmond-based startup, [EdConenctive](https://www.edconnective.com/ "EdConnective").
